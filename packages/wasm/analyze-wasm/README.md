[Snipkit][snipkit] helps developers protect their apps in just a few lines of
code. Implement rate limiting, bot protection, email verification, and defense
against common attacks.

This package provides WebAssembly bindings to [Snipkit's][snipkit] local analysis engine.

## Installation

```shell
npm install -S @snipkit/analyze-wasm
```

## Implementation

This package provides analyze logic implemented as a WebAssembly module which
will run local analysis on request details.

The `_virtual/snipkit_analyze_js_req.component.core.js` file contains the binary inlined as
a base64 [Data URL][mdn-data-url] with the `application/wasm` MIME type.

This was chosen to save on storage space over inlining the file directly as a
Uint8Array, which would take up ~3x the space of the Wasm file. See
[Better Binary Batter: Mixing Base64 and Uint8Array][wasm-base64-blog] for more
details.

It is then decoded into an ArrayBuffer to be used directly via WebAssembly's
`compile()` function in our entry point file.

This is all done to avoid trying to read or bundle the Wasm asset in various
ways based on the platform or bundler a user is targeting. One example being
that Next.js requires special `asyncWebAssembly` webpack config to load our
Wasm file if we don't do this.

In the future, we hope to do away with this workaround when all bundlers
properly support consistent asset bundling techniques.
